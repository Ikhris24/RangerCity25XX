A special thank you to Ian “iw” Walshaw for his excellent coding, detailed comments and for fixing a massive list of bugs starting with version 1.1.1 Simply put, progs_dump would not have been as stable and ambitious without him.

FTEQW (Revision 6282 and above)
https://www.fteqw.org/

==============================================================================
We no longer recommend Darkplaces or MarkV for progs_dump. Although many 
features will work, these engines are untested and unsupported.
==============================================================================

==============================================================================

Known issues:

GENERAL ISSUES:

* progs_dump is untested in COOP
* Cutscenes display crosshairs if enabled.
* Using snd_hit on a style 4 or 5 monster_army will crash the game. Use style 3
  if you need a custom hit sound.

KEX ENGINE:

* Cutscenes "jitter" when mouse is moved.
* Some systems will have frame rate dips when Chthon is gibbed in the KEX engine.
* The sky in pd_cutscenes displays artifacts. This is an issue with the non-standard 
  sky texture used in this map.
* "Congratulations" graphics does not display when using info_intermissiontext.

FTEQW:

* Cutscenes "jitter" when mouse is moved unless host_maxfps is set to 72.
* Sleeping Zombies in pd_zombies spawn incorrectly but do not affect game play. 
  As a workaround do not cover sleeping zombies with any brushes if they are 
  touching the monster.
* Rendering issues in certain presets. We recommend using "Spasm, Vanilla"
  or "Normal" Graphics Presets in the Option menu.
* misc_model set to animate in reverse (speed -0.1) will not animate.
* A speed setting of -1 (change instantly) does not work on trigger_fog
